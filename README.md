# Status of Covid 19 Cases in Ontario


#### This is just keeping track of the Covid 19 numbers in Ontario, and generating some plots since I couldn't find plots specifically for Ontario anywhere. The most interesting figures are the ""Percentage of Tests Positive for COVID-19 on Each Day", "Daily cases, recoveries, and deaths" and "Number of active Covid-19 cases in Ontario" plots.


Data updated daily from here: https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19


No modelling or anything is being done (although I might in the future). Feel free to use the data yourself.
